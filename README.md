SimpleStackCalculator takes input from the user and evaluates expressions.
If given a number it is pushed onto the stack, if given an operator the
result of the operation is pushed onto the stack. "p" prints the top
element of the stack, "P" pops the stack, "c" clears the stack,
"d" duplicates the top element on the stack, "r" reverses the top entries
 on the stack
